# KRE Valid Transaction Guidelines V3

These Kin Rewards Engine Valid Transaction Guidelines (the "KRE Transaction Guidelines") are supplemental and subject to the [Kin Foundation Developer Guidelines](https://www.kin.org/developers/guidelines.pdf)

The valid transaction guidelines can be found [here](https://developer.kin.org/docs/transaction-guide/). Apps must satisfy these requirements to be eligible for rewards from the KRE.

See [handling violations](https://github.com/kinecosystem/rewards-engine/blob/master/KRE%20Transaction%20Guidelines%20Procedure.md) for details of the process when a spend violation occurs or is reported in an app.
