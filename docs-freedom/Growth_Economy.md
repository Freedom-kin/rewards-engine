## How will this proposal help grow the Kin Economy?

Growth requires **Economic Activity** which is **the flow of money that users send through all the apps in the economy.**

Users need to be 'tempted' to take their Kin out of their wallets and spend it. You are not doing that by rewarding them with high interest rates because that is an incentive to keep Kin IN the wallets.

Central banks use this tool to steer the economy.
If they want to **cool down** the economy, they raise interest rates and people stop spending. If you want to stimulate the economy, you shouldn't do that.

How do you tempt users to SPEND? By giving them a lot of options to spend their money. A large shopping center will attract more visitors than one single shop in the street.

Provide interesting buying opportunities and customers present themselves.

So what we need to do is encourage developers to generate SPEND possibilities. That's a lot harder than giving Kin away. Therefore, this proposal is going to reward net SPENDS instead of high balances in user wallets.

If developers receive a 30% bonus on top of their net turnover, that would be an incentive to sell more.

**It will be an incentive for larger apps to join the Kin Economy.** Where else do you get a 30% bonus on top of your net turnover?

**It's also an incentive NOT to use other cryptocurrencies that users can pay with.** That would go at the expense of their turnover in Kin. Loyalty to the Kin Economy yields more rewards.

SPEND opportunities thus lead to more Economic Activity, which will increase the value of Kin and attract more visitors.

This will lead to growth of the Kin Economy.
